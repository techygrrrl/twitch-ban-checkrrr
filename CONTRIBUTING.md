## Ways to Contribute

There are a number of ways you can contribute:

- Improving documentation
- Logging bugs
- Fixing bugs
- Creating feature requests
- Implementing feature requests

### Bug Fixes

If you find a bug, please create an issue for it under the **Bug Report** template. 

Please ensure an existing ticket for the same issue doesn't already exist otherwise your ticket will be closed as a duplicate.

It is better to comment on the existing issue than creating a new issue.


### New Features

If you would like to request or build a new feature, please ensure there's an issue created for it already.

If there isn't an issue, please create one. Please also look for existing, related issues before creating a new one.


### Documentation

If you think you can improve the documentation to make it easier for newer developers, please feel free to log an issue explaining the current concerns and what information you'd include to improve it. Once your suggestions are improved, you are welcome to create a fork, push up your changes, and submit a merge request.


## Issue Approval process

All created issues will be reviewed. Once approved, which will be denoted by an `approved` tag, they are open for contributions. Please indicate in the issue's comments your interest to contribute to it. Once it gets approved, it will be open for contributions.

Please note, if you create a pull request without having created an issue or discussed it with me, it is possible the idea will not get merged in. To ensure you are contributions are accepted, please create an issue and get it approved before proceeding to contribute.


## What if my idea was rejected?

It is possible that maybe your idea doesn't get approved. This could be because it is out of scope for the goal of this project, for example, since this project is about finding out if a user has been banned, if you request a feature related to channel point redemptions, that is likely to get rejected due to being out of scope of the goal of the project.

You are welcome to fork the project and add your enhancements on your own fork and use that instead.
